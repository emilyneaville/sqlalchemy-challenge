# SQLAlchemy weather station analysis and Flask API design
Woohoo! I'm going to Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with my trip planning, I want to do a climate analysis about the area. I'm interested in seeing a visualization of the latest year's worth of precipitation in Hawaii as well as designing a Flask API so I can retrieve historical weather data.

## Part 1: Analyze and Explore the Climate Data
In this file, I used Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of the climate database. I utilized SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib to analyze the dataset and visualize the latest year's worth of weather data.
